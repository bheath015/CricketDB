Motivation for the Idea

As a sport that began in the late 16th century that has many unique rules and terminology, cricket offers good existing interesting statistical information that lends itself to a database project. We wanted to find a topic that has good robust datasets as well as be compelling to all our team members. For two of our Indian team members, cricket is practically the national sport in terms of popularity and offers intrigue to them as life long fans. For our American team members, it is a great opportunity to learn about a popular international sport as well as gain insight into a very important aspect of Indian culture.
