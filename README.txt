#####    Welcome Page    #####

On our welcome page, you are invited to log into the web app. This will allow us to store your personal username and password into a database where we can also store you favorite team and player.

#####     Team Page      #####

Our team page presents a profile of your favorite team. Simply enter you favorite team into the search bar (if you don't have one, type in a random letter and select one from the dropdown of available teams) and click enter. This will direct you to your team's profile page. On this page, we query:
-The Roster from the SQL Database (if one is available for the team)
-An image associated with each player from the Mongo Database
-The bowling and batting handedness of each player from the SQL Database
-Rotating queries about each team which include:
--The proportion of right vs left handed bowlers by team
--The proportion of old vs. young players by team (>= or < 25)
--The number of Ducks on a team
--The home win percentage of a team

We also show the crest of your favorite team.

#####    Requirements    #####

Our web app is a Flask Application (Flask is a web framework written in Python). Therefore, you will need to download Flask and run it within a Python2 environment. 

Because our application relies on robust databases with Cricket team and player information, you will need to also download MySQL-Connector and PyMongo. We use a MySQL instance to hold our basic player and team information, and a Mongo database to hold our more in-depth player data.

##### Running the Program #####

In the flaskApp directory, run the command `FLASK_APP=index.py flask run` and you are good to go!
