#####    Requirements    #####

Our web app is a Flask Application (Flask is a web framework written in Python). Therefore, you will need to download Flask and run it within a Python2 environment. 

Because our application relies on robust databases with Cricket team and player information, you will need to also download MySQL-Connector and PyMongo. We use a MySQL instance to hold our basic player and team information, and a Mongo database to hold our more in-depth player data.
